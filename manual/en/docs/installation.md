In order to run [Tracardi](http://www.tracardi.com) you must have docker installed on your linux machine. Please refer to [docker installation manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
to see how to install docker. 

Once the docker is installed go to main folder of tracardi and run.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will build and install tracardi and all required dependencies such as unomi and elastic on your computer. 
Hence that this type of setup is for demonstration purpose only.
