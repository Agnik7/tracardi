# Running Tracardi

After a while when everything is downloaded and installed open browser and go to http://0.0.0.0/app
Login with default:

```
 user: karaf
 password: karaf
```

## User interface authentication
Default user and password are configured in a docker compose file:

* UNOMI_USERNAME (default: karaf) and 
* UNOMI_PASSWORD(default: karaf)

Access to Tracardi interface is restricted by the Unomi password. 
If you change Unomi password you will have to change it in Tracardi 
as well.
